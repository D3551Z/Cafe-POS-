How to run the application: Start at the registerpage, where you can register an account and then proceed on. You will use your registered account
in the login page too. Overall the application performs best in Firefox, in Chrome the registration page and login has some weird refresh bug
where you need to register twice. The printing PDF works best in Chrome however, where in Firefox it might freeze the window for a bit.
